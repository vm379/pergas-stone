                        <h1>Marble</h1>

                        <p>Today we’ll talk about one of the commonly used stones in the interior - marble. Marble (from
                            Greek
                            “shining stone”) is a metamorphic rock, consisting mainly of minerals calcite CaCO3
                            (limestone) or
                            dolomite CaMg (CO3) 2, formed as a result of recrystallization of carbonates
                            (carbon-containing
                            compounds) for more than 2.5-4 billion years back under the influence of high temperatures
                            and
                            pressure. One type of marble is called Pietra Gray. This is an exquisite marble in demand
                            all over
                            the world. An even, dark stone background is cut by graphic straight veins of white color.
                            Polished,
                            this natural marble takes on a deep gray color.</p>
